1. Click the button above to visit railway.app.

2. Click on the **Deploy Now** button.

3. (Optional) Sign in with GitHub to deploy.

4. Fill in the Repository details:

   - Specify the repo name of your choice.
   - Checkmark for Public/Private repository.

5. For Environment variables, we have provided some default values in the `ENV` to reduce the burden, but you can modify them as per your requirements.

7. Once you fill in the required environment parameters click on the **Deploy** button to trigger the first build.

   -  Monitor the server logs; if you come across any deployment problems, feel free to raise an issue for our team to look into.

Note: Once the application is deployed, please wait for 3-5 minutes for the swagger docs to be available. As the project is deployed on a free server, it may take a few seconds to load the Swagger documentation. So please be patient.

# üìö Interactive API Documentation
